**Best Practices:**
    * Use the `motion` component for all animatable elements.
    * Define clear, readable `variants` objects for complex state management.
    * Use a realistic, modern transition configuration (e.g., `type: "spring"` with subtle damping/stiffness).
    * Ensure the component is **fully functional and visually appealing** as a standalone demo.
    * The demo should illustrate a common UI pattern (e.g., a card, a button, a loading indicator, or a scrolling effect).

**UI/Style Guidelines**
* **Design:** Follow the existing UI guidelines for style, favoring a **clean, modern, minimalist** aesthetic (like Vercel/Stripe).
* **Responsiveness:** Ensure the component looks good on both mobile and desktop views.
* **Color:** Use a subtle, harmonious color palette with high contrast for text.
* **Assets:** Do not include external assets (images/icons) unless absolutely necessary to make the demo functional (e.g., a simple Lucide icon for a button).

**Response Format**
Do not mention `framer-motion` or any other library name in the prose, just in the code.
